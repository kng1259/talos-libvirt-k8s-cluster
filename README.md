# Talos Libvirt K8s cluster Template
This project provides a template for creating a Kubernetes cluster using Talos OS and Libvirt.

## Overview

This template automates the deployment of a Kubernetes cluster with Talos OS running on Libvirt virtual machines. It simplifies the process of setting up a local Kubernetes environment for development, testing, and learning purposes.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux host with Libvirt installed
- `kubectl` CLI tool
- `talosctl` CLI tool
- Sufficient resources to run multiple VMs

## Includes
- `Vagrantfile` to manage VMs
- `image.yaml` specifying the Talos Linux image needed (for Longhorn in this case)
- `commands.sh` including some complex commands
- `talospatches` to patch on top of autogenerated talosconfigs
- `helmpatches` to patch on top of helm charts
